Initial Password: Odoo@1234
First Login: Must change to new password
Anytime: Can change in Security tab
Requirements: Minimum 6 characters
Hashing: Bcrypt with cost=10
```

### Role-Based Access
```
Employee Role:
- Edit: Name, email, mobile, personal email, DOB, address, gender, marital status
- View: Job position, department, manager, company, salary (read-only)
- Actions: Upload profile pic, change password, logout

HR Role:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    login_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

5. Employee enters new password and confirms
6. Employee redirected to index.html (profile)
7. Employee can edit only personal information
8. Employee can view salary (read-only)
9. Employee can change password anytime in Security tab

### HR Testing
1. HR logs in at login.html
2. HR navigated to admin_profile.html
3. HR can add employees via signup.html button
4. HR can manage all employee information
5. HR can view salary dashboard via hr_salary_dashboard.html
6. HR can export salary data to CSV
7. HR can edit salary components for any employee

- `js/login.js` → Validates and submits to PHP
- `php/login.php` → Authenticates against database
- Returns user info + first_login flag

### Employee Registration
- `signup.html` → HR fills employee form
- `js/signup.js` → Generates Login ID and submits
- `php/signup.php` → Creates employee + user account

### Password Management
- `index.html` → Shows password change modal
- `js/profile.js` → Handles password change logic
- `php/change_first_password.php` → Updates password on first login
- `php/change_password.php` → Updates password anytime

### Session Management
- `php/session_check.php` → Verifies user is logged in
- `localStorage` → Stores role and user ID client-side
- `logout()` → Clears session and redirects to login

## 💡 How It Works - Flow Diagrams

### First Time Employee Login
```
login.html
    ↓
js/login.js validates input
    ↓
POST /php/login.php (loginId, password)
    ↓
php/login.php finds user, checks password with password_verify()
    ↓ (if first_login = true)
Response: {success: true, needs_password_change: true}
    ↓
Show password change modal
    ↓
Employee enters new password
    ↓
POST /php/change_first_password.php
    ↓
php/change_first_password.php updates password and sets first_login = false
    ↓
Redirect to index.html (profile page)
```

### Employee Adding by HR
```
signup.html (HR only)
    ↓
Fill employee details
    ↓
Auto-generate Login ID (OIJODO20220001)
    ↓
Click "Add Employee"
    ↓
POST /php/signup.php
    ↓
php/signup.php:
  - Inserts into employees table
  - Hashes password (Odoo@1234)
  - Inserts into users table
  - Sets first_login = true
    ↓
Response: {success: true, loginId: "OIJODO20220001"}
    ↓
HR gets Login ID, shares with employee
    ↓
Employee uses ID + Odoo@1234 to login (forced password change on first login)
```

## ✨ Special Features

### Auto-Generated Login ID
- Format: OI + initials + year + serial
- Ensures uniqueness
- Human-readable
- Easy to remember (relative to GUIDs)

### First-Time Password Change
- Mandatory on first login
- User cannot skip
- Modal prevents access until changed
- Password must be different from default

### Remember Me
- Stores Login ID in localStorage
- Pre-fills login field on return visit
- Secure: only stores login ID, not password
- User can uncheck to clear

### Logout Everywhere
- Clears localStorage completely
- Redirects to login page
- Forces re-authentication
- Available on all pages via navbar button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Login Issues
- Check database connection in `php/config.php`
- Verify `users` table exists and has data
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Verify password was hashed correctly

### Employee Registration Issues  
- Ensure you're logged in as HR
- Check `employees` table exists
- Verify `users` table has been created
- Check for duplicate Login ID or Email

### Password Change Issues
- Check `first_login` flag is correct in database
- Verify password meets minimum length (6 chars)
- Check browser console for validation errors
- Clear cache and try again

### Session Issues
- Check browser allows cookies (required for sessions)
- Verify `php/session_check.php` returns valid response
- Check localStorage has userRole set
- Try logout and login again
